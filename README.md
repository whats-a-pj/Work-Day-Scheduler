# Work Day Scheduler
## Why was this project created?

This project was created so that a user can easily put together a daily planner and store that planner on their cell phone for convenience!

## What does this application solve?
This project helps a user to plan their day according to deadlines and to productively fill their time at work or even just at home. The cool thing about this is that when they click save and come back to the page later, their tasks are still on the page. Having different colors for past present and future time slots is visually beneficial so that the user can tell if they have fallen behind or are ahead of schedule.

## What this project has taught me
This project has taught me that breaking things down into smaller issues still trumps trying to tackle the entire project at once. I learned how to properly console.log things so that I can have a better understanding of my bugs. I realized that my resources online sometimes are not exhaustive depending on the methods and syntax I am using. I experimented with shorthand if statements as well (ternary operators) and that was actually quite useful when it came to using less code for a single function. This project has also taught me that I need to do a lot more research in the jQuery division to get a better grasp of the syntax, I appreciate that it is similar to the API methods we use for Javascript but finding the correct examples/use cases online got a little tricky at times.

Cloned starter code

Started looking over the html file to get a feel of the classes and id's

Added more div ids for each hour (9am-5pm)

Dived in to research jquery methods and dayjs

Implemented what I had a firm grasp of to my script.js file

Moved things in and out of local/global scope because functions weren't running properly

Console logged things as I went along so I could debug and understand what wasn't working

Realized it would be easier to do dayjs().hour() instead of dayjs().format("hA")

Brian Whisler walked me through creating a function to convert my hours

Added an if statement in that function for the 12PM div in my html file

Updated README

Deployed site, but deployed site was just the README instead of the contents in my develop folder.

Took all my files out of my develop folder

Ran into an error, had to move them back in

Then had to take all the files out of my develop folder again

Also had a study group with Brian Whisler and Salvador Mejia on 7/16 just to go over and make sure we understood this last week's module. Brian already has experience with these things but me and Salvador are still getting the hang of jquery and dayjs so even though we had starter code with descriptive notes for guidance, it still proved to be a challenge.
